PROJECT TITLE: FuelCostCalc
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Enable the calculation of how much a trip costed (or will cost) in british
pounds using miles, miles-per-gallon (imperial) and pence-per-litre. 
VERSION & DATE: 1.0, 2022/11/01
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Using the main method, type 'java FuelCostCalc' in the package's main
directory (you will need java installed for this to work); or by creating an instance of the
 UserInterface in BlueJ or similar program.
AUTHORS: Mark Gregory
USER INSTRUCTIONS: See 'how to start...' above. Currently the program only calculates journeys,
I'm looking at adding a save and load ability so that multiple journeys/calculations can be
stored and retrieved.
